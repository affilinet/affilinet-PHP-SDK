<p>
  Shops can define custom properties for filtering their products.

   <br>
   Advertisers can provide us with 3 types of data for each product:
   <ul>
   <li>obligatory fields (e.g. price or deeplink)</li>
   <li>optional fields (e.g. brand or distributor)</li>
   <li> custom fields (which we call “product properties” or "shop properties").</li>
</ul>
   <br>
   The latter type is very flexible: every additional column which a shop delivers to us, is handed out to
   the publishers with un-altered name. So a shoe shop can provide us with custom fields / product
   properties like “size” or “material”, while a notebook shop can send us “HDD capacity”, “Screen
   Size”, “CPU speed” etc...
   <br>
   With this method, you can specify a ShopId and we send back to you, what properties this shop has
   and how many of its products have this property set.

<strong>Get Shop Properties</strong>

{% highlight php linenos %}
<?php
// create a ShopPropertiesRequest Object
$shopPropertiesRequest = new \Affilinet\ProductData\Requests\ShopPropertiesRequest($affilinet);

$shopPropertiesRequest->setShopId(123456'); // where '123456' has to be the valid shopId of course

$shopPropertiesResponse = $shopPropertiesRequest->send();

echo 'Total Shop Properties : ' . $shopPropertiesResponse->totalProperties();
echo 'Total Shop Properties : ' . $shopPropertiesResponse->totalRecords(); // alias function

$shopPropertiesResponse->hasProperty('size'); // will return true if you can use "size" as a filter for this shop

// get all shop properties
foreach ($shopPropertiesResponse->getProperties() as $shopProperty) {
   /** @var $shopProperty Affilinet\ProductData\Responses\ResponseElements\ShopProperty
   $shopProperty->getPropertyName();   // the name of this filter for example "size"
   $shopProperty->getTotalCount();     // the number of total results where this filter is set
}
